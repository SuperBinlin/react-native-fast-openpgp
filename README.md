## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-fast-openpgp --save`

## JSI


If you want to use with `JSI` instead of `NativeModules` you need to set

```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

OpenPGP.useJSI = true;
```
if you need to use generate methods it is a good idea to disable it, because for now JSI will block your UI but it is faster compared to NativeModules


## Usage

### Encrypt methods
```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

const encrypted = await OpenPGP.encrypt(message: string, publicKey: string, signedEntity?: Entity, fileHints?: FileHints, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;
const outputFile = await OpenPGP.encryptFile(inputFile: string, outputFile: string, publicKey: string, signedEntity?: Entity, fileHints?: FileHints, options?: KeyOptions): Promise<number>;

const encryptedSymmetric = await OpenPGP.encryptSymmetric(message: string, passphrase: string, fileHints?: FileHints, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;
const outputFile = await OpenPGP.encryptSymmetricFile(inputFile: string, outputFile: string, passphrase: string, fileHints?: FileHints, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<number> ;
```

### Decrypt methods
```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

const decrypted = await OpenPGP.decrypt(message: string, privateKey: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;
const outputFile = await OpenPGP.decryptFile(inputFile: string, outputFile: string, privateKey: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<number>;

const decryptedSymmetric = await OpenPGP.decryptSymmetric(message: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;
const outputFile = await OpenPGP.decryptSymmetricFile(inputFile: string, outputFile: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<number> ;
```

### Sign and Verify methods
```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

const signed = await OpenPGP.sign(message: string, publicKey: string, privateKey: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;
const signed = await OpenPGP.signFile(inputFile: string, publicKey: string, privateKey: string, passphrase: string, options?: KeyOptions ): Promise<string>;

const verified = await OpenPGP.verify(signature: string, message: string, publicKey: string ): Promise<boolean>;
const verified = await OpenPGP.verifyFile(signature: string, inputFile: string,publicKey: string): Promise<boolean>;
```


### Generate
```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

const generated = await OpenPGP.generate(options: Options): Promise<KeyPair>;
```

### Encrypt with multiple keys

```typescript
import OpenPGP from "react-native-fast-openpgp";

const publicKeys = `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

mQENBF0Tpe0BCADm+ja4vMKuodkQEhLm/092M/6gt4TaKwzv8QcA53/FrM3g8wab
D4m65Neoc7DBEdvzgK9IUMpwG5N0t+0pfWLhs8AZdMxE7RbP
=kbtq
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

mQENBF0Tpe0BCADm+ja4vMKuodkQEhLm/092M/6gt4TaKwzv8QcA53/FrM3g8wab

-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

=kbtq
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`;
const encrypted = await OpenPGP.encrypt("sample text" publicKeys);
```
